Hej! Greetings from Sverige!!

I wanna make things easier so I made this something kinda like a tutorial.

I recommend you have your RStudio set for running this example.

Make sure you have downloaded and loaded packages in SEBJ_Packages.R

And also, you need to set your working directory in this R code

So when you wanna download species file from GBIF, just run: SEBJ_Download.R

After Download / Or you have downloaded the presence file you need

Please run SEBJ_Read.R to have all your existing data ready

Then you can run BioClim/GLM/MaxEnt/RF for species prediction!

The Bias Control is based on Zizka 2021, to see the extent and factors that affecting the bias.

Also, the major part of these codes have referenced Matthew Dennis from the University of Manchester, United Kingdom.

Good luck with your project!!
